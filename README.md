# PasswordGenerator
This is the third task for the motion cut internship. For this, task I have created a random password generator. 
In this, I have used the string module which is useful to work easily with the strings and to get the uppercase, lowercase, digits and symbols all with a single function instead of hard-coding all of them.
I have also used the random module for using the shuffle() method to shuffle the list containing all the above mentioned elements. 
This simple tool is helpful to create a strong password in a very easy way.
